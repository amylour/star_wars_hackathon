## **Project Goals**

Based on the Code Institute Hackathon May 2023 Theme of "May the 4th be with you", create a Star Wars-themed browser-platform game. The game should be fully functioning with as little bugs as possible, and playable by users of all ages. 


## **User Experience**

This game offers a level-based gaming experience where players can progress with win onto the next leveled adventure in the Star Wars universe. Several things can be expected from the game:

* **Star Wars Pop-Culture references:** Throughout the game, various pop-culture references can be understood by the user if they are a Star Wars fans. The use of lightsabers, clones, Darth Vader helmets as sprites, as well as the beautifully made retro backgrounds are a few examples of these references.

* **Controls:** The user is able to use the arrow keypad to move their lightsaber sprite and make smart, calculated decisions about where to move around the environment.

* **Progressive Challenge:** The player is brought between 3 levels, beginning with level 1, an easier, standard level, then to level 2, more moderate and finally to the 3rd level, which is significantly harder than the previous: thus the user is put under pressure and is challenged to be clever about their strategy.

* **Retro Environment:** Our team specifically chose to develop graphic designs based around a retro-themed environment. All the sprites, backgrounds, items, health containers and general features have been made in an attempt to give a "retro" feel to the application.

* **Immersive Sound:** Retro audio has been caringly added to the gaming environment so match the retro environment and immerse the player into their gaming experience.


## **Target Audience**

Our target audience is a range of absolutely any person that can use a computer, thus any user from a young age to senior.

## **Design**

### **Design Choices**

#### **_Components_**

The components of this project were inspired by classic pixel art and were painted in Procreate.

#### **_Level Backgrounds_**

The backgrounds for this project were painted in Procreate. They have been inspired by classic pixel art and the Game Boy Advance game [Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_III_%E2%80%93_Revenge_of_the_Sith_(video_game))

### **Colour**

### **Fonts**

The fonts that we used were 'Noto Sans Display' from [Google Fonts](https://www.googlefonts.com) for the body text and 'SF Distant Galaxy' from [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/sf-distant-galaxy.font)

### **Music & Sounds**

The music for game was created using a combination of Rytmik Studio and Rytmik Ultimate. As the art was inspired by a Gameboy Advanced game, it made a lot of sense to keep the retro theme for the music too. So a chiptune style was chosen to match it.

The full song can be found [here](https://soundcloud.com/welshynatorjones/saber-scroll-theme).

### **Wireframes**
Some basic wireframes were created so the team could be on the same page when creating the layout during coding sessions.

### **Existing Features**

### Start Modal

This is the first page that appears on the top of the screen. The Saber Scroll image is added and then the welcome message with the rules of this Game (note the rules change for each level). There is a button that enables user to start playing the game.

- Level 1 start modal screen

- [Level 2 start modal screen](https://github.com/amylour/star_wars_hackathon/blob/main/readme-assets/start-modal-lv2-fullscreen.png)
- [Final level start modal screen](https://github.com/amylour/star_wars_hackathon/blob/main/readme-assets/start-modal-final-level-fullscreen.png)

### Game Screen

When the user wants to play the game using the play button the game screen reveals. On the top of the screen the Saber Scroll image is present, with a timer on the right and a live counter in the left. UNderneath the game container, there is a on/off button for audio.
This page also includes footer. On the left side of the page, copyright deatils are present and on the right side, links to developer's GitHub page are added.

## **Testing**

## **Bugs**

### **Fixed bugs**

To find a list of fixed bugs that were mended during development, please click [here](https://github.com/amylour/star_wars_hackathon/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

### **Remaining bugs**

* Depending on where the lightsaber sprite + vader sprite spawn, if they by chance spawn in the exact same spot, the gameOver() function will be called until they move away, creating a pseudo-loop.

* The Start button when pressed continuously speeds up the sprite and player movement.


## **Validator Testing**

### **HTML Validator**

The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) for the HTML code was passed in as a URL and returned no errors.

## **Deployment, Development & Version Control**

The development environment used for this project was GitPod.

Each software developer on the team created their own individual branch divergent from main from the get-go and have communicated via Slack to collaborate, pitch ideas, fix bugs and talk about relevant Pull Requests. Regular commits and pushes to Github have been employed to be able to track and trace the development process of the web application.

For local deployments instructions shall be written below, along with instructions with deployment to GitHub Pages, the hosting service used to deploy this particular website.

### **Local Deployment**
