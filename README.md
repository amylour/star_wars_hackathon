## **Project Goals**

Based on the Code Institute Hackathon May 2023 Theme of "May the 4th be with you", create a Star Wars-themed browser-platform game. The game should be fully functioning with as little bugs as possible, and playable by users of all ages. 


## **User Experience**

This game offers a level-based gaming experience where players can progress with win onto the next leveled adventure in the Star Wars universe. Several things can be expected from the game:

* **Star Wars Pop-Culture references:** Throughout the game, various pop-culture references can be understood by the user if they are a Star Wars fans. The use of lightsabers, clones, Darth Vader helmets as sprites, as well as the beautifully made retro backgrounds are a few examples of these references.

* **Controls:** The user is able to use the arrow keypad to move their lightsaber sprite and make smart, calculated decisions about where to move around the environment.

* **Progressive Challenge:** The player is brought between 3 levels, beginning with level 1, an easier, standard level, then to level 2, more moderate and finally to the 3rd level, which is significantly harder than the previous: thus the user is put under pressure and is challenged to be clever about their strategy.

* **Retro Environment:** Our team specifically chose to develop graphic designs based around a retro-themed environment. All the sprites, backgrounds, items, health containers and general features have been made in an attempt to give a "retro" feel to the application.

* **Immersive Sound:** Retro audio has been caringly added to the gaming environment so match the retro environment and immerse the player into their gaming experience.


## **Target Audience**

Our target audience is a range of absolutely any person that can use a computer, thus any user from a young age to senior.
